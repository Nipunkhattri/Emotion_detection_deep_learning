# Emotion Detection Using Deep Learning and OpenCV

## Overview

This project is an Emotion Detection system that leverages deep learning models and OpenCV to analyze facial expressions and identify emotions. It is designed to recognize and classify emotions from facial images or video streams, providing valuable insights for various applications such as user experience enhancement, mental health monitoring, and more.

## Features

- Real-time emotion detection from video feeds or images.
- Classification of emotions into categories like Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprise, Disgust, and Fear.
- Integration with OpenCV for image processing and display.

## Technologies Used

- **Deep Learning Framework**: TensorFlow/Keras
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV
- **Programming Language**: Python
